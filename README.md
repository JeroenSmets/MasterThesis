Situation:

The empty assembly board is placed in the two-dimensional worksurface. The objects (resistance, capacitor, and coil) are arbitrary placed next to the assembly surface. The goal is to place all objects on the right place of the crossover board. For this, we need an appropriate knowledge representation of the assembly board and the objects. Next to that, these components can be related to the work plane in order to represent their positions. 


Entities:

•	Objects (resistance, capacitor, and coil)

•	Crossover board

•	Worksurface


Relations:

•	ObjectsToWorksurface

•	CrossoverToWorksurface
